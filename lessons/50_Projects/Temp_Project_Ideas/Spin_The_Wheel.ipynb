    "Typically, a *Spin The Wheel* game consists of a wheel divided into sections, each representing a different prize. Players take turns spinning the wheel, and wherever the wheel stops determines the prize they win. However, feel free to add your own twist to the game! This is your chance to get creative and have fun.\n",

Is the prize monetary, points-based, or something else? Maybe it's just some funny message?\n",
