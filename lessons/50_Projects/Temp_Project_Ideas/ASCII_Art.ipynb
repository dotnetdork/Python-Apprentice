    "\n",
    "ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses printable characters from the ASCII standard to create images and designs. It originated in the early days of computers when graphical capabilities were limited, and artists used text characters to create visual representations.\n",

    "Examples of ASCII art can include simple designs like smiley faces to more complex images like landscapes, portraits, and intricate patterns.\n",

The animation part is a bit more advanced and typically requires additional programming techniques beyond basic loops, such as manipulating the console output or using libraries designed for creating animations.\n",
