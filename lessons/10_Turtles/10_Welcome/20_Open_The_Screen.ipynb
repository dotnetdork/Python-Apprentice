Now, to see your turtle's drawings, you just need to open a virtual screen. Don't worry, this part is easy.\n",

If for some reason it doesn't appear, just look for the little monitor icon <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"https://images.jointheleague.org/vscode/monitor_icon.png\" height=\"25px\" > in the top right corner of your editor and click on it.\n",
