Welcome to your first <span title=\"Python is a popular programming language that's known for being powerful, simple, and easy to read\" style=\"cursor: help\">**Python**</span> lesson with the *League of Amazing Programmers*.

It's almost like having a little robot artist \ud83e\udd16 that you can control with code. To do this, we'll use a pre-installed Python tool called the <span title=\"The turtle module is a pre-installed graphics library commonly used for creating drawings and animations.\" style=\"cursor: help\">**turtle module**</span>. \n",
