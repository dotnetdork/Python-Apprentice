    "# **What Can Tina Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, you met Tina the Turtle in a program that might have looked a little complicated. Don‚Äôt get intimidated‚ÄîTina‚Äôs magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is actually very simple and can be broken down into basic steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next program, `02c_Squares_and_Circles`, you‚Äôll see a much simpler example. Tina will only draw a square and a circle, your task will be to read the program, figure out what it does, and make some fun changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we move ahead, let‚Äôs break down how this magic ‚ú® works!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How Tina Follows Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what some of the program will look like with <span title=\"Comments start with a '#' and explain what the code does\" style=\"cursor: help;\">comments</span> to explain what each line does: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "tina = turtle.Turtle()                  # Make a turtle named tina\n",
    "tina.pencolor('blue')                   # Change tina's pen color to blue\n",
    "tina.forward(200)                       # Move tina forward by 200 steps\n",
    "tina.right(90)                          # Turn tina right by 90 degrees\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code before the `#` is a *command* ‚Äî it tells Tina exactly what action to perform.\n",
    "- The text after the `#` is a *comment* ‚Äî it explains what the command does, but does not affect the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the steps below, and when you‚Äôre ready, move on to the <span style=\"background-color: #0099ffff; color: white; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 4px;\"><strong>Next Lesson</strong></span> and keep exploring  what Tina can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the program** called `02c_Squares_and_Circles` to see what Tina draws.\n",
    "2. **Read the code.** For each line, try to guess what Tina will do. (The comments will help!)\n",
    "3. **Change the program:**\n",
    "    - Make Tina draw a square and a circle of different sizes and colors.\n",
    "    - Try changing the numbers and colors in the commands to see what happens!\n",
    "4. **Run the program again** and see how Tina‚Äôs drawing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** If you‚Äôre not sure what a command does, try changing it and running the program again. Playing and experimenting is a great way to learn!"
