# Squares and Circles

1. Run the program `Squares_and_Circles.py` to see what it does.
2. Read through the program, using the comments to help you, and try to understand what each command does.
3. Try modifying the program's values so that Tina draws a square and a circle with different sizes and colors. 
4. Run the program again to see how your changes affect the drawing.
