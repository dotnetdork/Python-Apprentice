In this lesson, you'll discover how loops make programming easier and more powerful by allowing you to automate repetitive tasks, save time, write cleaner code, and solve problems more efficiently. By pairing loops with *Tina the Turtle*, you'll learn how to simplify your programs, reduce mistakes, and create amazing things with less effort!"
