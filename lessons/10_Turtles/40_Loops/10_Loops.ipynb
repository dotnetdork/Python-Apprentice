In this lesson, you'll discover how loops make programming easier and more powerful by allowing you to automate repetitive tasks, save time, write cleaner code, and solve problems more efficiently. By pairing loops with *Tina the Turtle*, you'll be able to simplify your programs, reduce mistakes, and create amazing things with less effort!\n",

Each time the loop runs, the variable `i` takes on the next value in that sequence (e.g., 0, then 1, then 2, then 3)."
