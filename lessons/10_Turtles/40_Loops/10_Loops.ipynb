    "Welcome to the world of <span title=\"A loop in programming is a structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a certain condition is met.\" style=\"cursor: help\">**loops**</span>! In this lesson, you'll discover how loops make programming easier and more powerful by allowing you to automate repetitive tasks, save time, write cleaner code, and solve problems more efficiently. By pairing loops with *Tina the Turtle*, you'll be able to simplify your programs, reduce mistakes, and create amazing things with less effort!\n",
