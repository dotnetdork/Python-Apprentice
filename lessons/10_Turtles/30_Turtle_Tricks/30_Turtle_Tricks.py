# 30_Turtle_Tricks.py

In this assignment, you will use Tina the Turtle to draw multiple shapes on the screen.

- Draw two circles, each filled with a different color.
- Position the circles in different locations on the screen (they should not overlap).
- Use the turtle commands: begin_fill(), end_fill(), fillcolor(), circle(), and goto() to complete the task.
- Challenge yourself to experiment with different colors and positions!

Refer to the previous program, Meet_Tina.py for examples of how to use these turtle commands.
