# 10_Turtle_Tricks.py

In this exercise, you will use Tina the Turtle to draw an equilateral triangle.

Objectives:
- Use the commands: tina.forward() and tina.left() to draw the three sides of the triangle.
- Change the pen color before drawing each side using tina.pencolor(), so each side is a different color.

Refer to previous turtle programs for examples of how to use these commands.
